# ACM for Nitro Enclaves config.
#
# This is an example of setting up ACM, with Nitro Enclaves and nginx.
# You can take this file and then:
# - copy it to /etc/nitro_enclaves/acm.yaml;
# - fill in your ACM certificate ARN in the `certificate_arn` field below;
# - make sure /etc/nginx/nginx.conf is set up to:
#   - use the pkcs11 SSL engine, and;
#   - include the stanza file configured below (under `NginxStanza`)
#     somewhere in the nginx.conf `server` section;
# - start the nitro-enclaves-acm service.
#
# Enclave general configuration
enclave:
  # Number of vCPUs to be assigned to the enclave
  cpu_count: 2
  # Memory (in MiB) to be assigned to the enclave

options:
  # If NGINX is not running, force restart it
