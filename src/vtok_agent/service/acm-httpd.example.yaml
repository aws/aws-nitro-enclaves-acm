# ACM for Nitro Enclaves Apache HTTPD configuration
#
# This is an example of setting up ACM, with Nitro Enclaves and Apache Httpd.
# You can take this file and then:
# - Copy it to /etc/nitro_enclaves/acm.yaml
# - Fill in your ACM certificate ARN in the `certificate_arn` field below
# - Make sure `/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf` is set up to have the `IncludeOptional`
#   or `Include` directives to point to the virtual host configuration entries
# - Set the target `Conf` directive below to point to a virtual host
#   configuration location
# - Start the nitro-enclaves-acm service
#
# Enclave general configuration
enclave:
  # Number of vCPUs to be assigned to the enclave
